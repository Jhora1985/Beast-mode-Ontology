# Beast Mode Examples

This directory contains example data demonstrating how the Beast Mode ontologies are intended to be used together.

The examples focus on clarity and intent rather than completeness or realism.

## Purpose

The goal of these examples is to show:
- how agents declare capabilities
- how capabilities enable tasks
- how messaging and network concepts may be referenced
- how the overall structure fits together

These examples are not reference implementations or production templates.

## What to Expect

Examples in this directory may include:
- simple agent definitions
- minimal capability and task graphs
- illustrative messaging and network relationships

They are intentionally small and readable.

## What Not to Expect

These examples do not include:
- execution logic
- runtime behavior
- orchestration flows
- infrastructure configuration

They exist to support understanding, not deployment.

## How to Use These Examples

Use these files to:
- explore the ontology structure
- validate SHACL constraints
- test extensions or tooling
- communicate intent to collaborators

You are encouraged to copy and adapt examples for your own experiments.

## Status

Examples will evolve as the ontology grows and additional modules are added.
